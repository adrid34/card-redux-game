React with Redux -- Card Game (WIP)
=============================

In order to develop my abstract thinking I figured it would be cool to make a game.
Recently I have been playing a lot of [Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft](http://us.battle.net/en/int?r=hearthstone)
and I realised that it would be great practice to rebuild it using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) with [Redux](http://redux.js.org/).

Follow me in the journey that will be rebuilding this amazing card game.

I am in no way affiliated with *Blizzard Entertainment* or *Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft* and see this
project as part of my learning experience.
